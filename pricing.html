	<dt>Per Line</dt>
	<dd>Per line commissions come at a rate of 1$/line. This option is only available for relatively small code projects. Ideally less than 50 lines.</dd>
	
	<br>
	
	<dt>Per Hour</dt>
	<dd>I charge 20$/hr currently for hourly work. This option is not available for smaller code-bases. Mostly available for projects which are expected to take 4-8 hours of time.</dd>
	
	<br>

<dt>Commission-Exclusive Basis</dt>
<dd>We can come up with an ideal price for the project given the dimensions of the commission as well. This is different than my other options in that we can get negotiate the price before I begin. You will pay 20% up front, and 80% once the project is completed.</dd>
