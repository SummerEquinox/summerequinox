<h2 class="home_page_body"> General </h2>
<b class="home_page_body"> My name is Riley and I have lived in Fuquay-Varina/Holly Springs for most of my life. I have a very strong programming foundation.
 This includes everything from luaJIT to Python and small bits of C\C++. I have been programming since I was 12, and freelance project
 programming since I was 14.</b>

<h2 class="home_page_body"> Interests and History </h2>
<p><b class="home_page_body">I was born in Raleigh, but grew up in Fuquay-Varina attending Ballentine Elementary School. As a kid I was really into Dragon Ball Z 
  and Yu-Gi-Oh. Nowadays I still find some of these shows interesting, but I am incredibly interested in fitness. I love bodybuilding and 
  train on a PPL (push-pull-legs) split 6x/week. I plan to compete in the future, but for right now I am sticking to casual training.</b></p>
